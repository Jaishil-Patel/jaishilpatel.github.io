        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey, I'm Jaishil Patel and I am currently studying Computer Science.
      I enjoy coding, coding and more coding:) 
      I am also learning how to use html and it's quite fun, for example I can have a picture of a dog on my website
         </p>
         <img src="dog.jpg" alt="Doggo" width="500">

         <p>
           I recently coded a snake AI that would compete against other's snakes.
           The goal was to have the longest snake, i.e., to survive the longest.
           I learned some interesting strategies like strategies to <strong>ELIMINATE</strong> other snakes. It was also interesting to observe how different algorithms would interact with each other.
