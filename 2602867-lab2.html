         <p>
           I recently coded a snake AI the would compete against other's sankes.
           The goal was to have the longest snake, ie. to survive the longest.
           I learnt some interesting strategies like strategies to <strong>KILL</strong> other snakes. It was also interesting to observe how different algorithms would interact with eachother.
